OOPS:
     Object Oriented Programming 
     
     It is  a design model or paradigm which helps the programmer to corelate real world scenerios into 
     the programming world scenerios in the form of object.

     Encapsulation 
     Inheritance
     Polymorphism 
     Abstraction

     States means variable 
     behaviour means method


Encapsulation:
    the binding or wrapping states and  behaviour of an object is known as Encapsulation.

why do we use Encapsulation?
    : To achive data hiding

What is data hiding?
    : The process oof avoiding direct access but providing controlled access is known as data hiding.

How to avoid direct access?
    : By using Private access modifier / Specifier.
    private keyword
    if we make any member  as private  so we cannot use that variable directly in different class. We can only useq directly in same class.

How to provide controlled access?
    : using getter and setter method .

What is the use of getter method?
    : used to get or retrive private method.
what is the sue of setter method?
    : used to set or modify private method.
  



Types of relationships in JAVA:
1: HAS-A relationship
2: IS -A relationship


HAS -A relationship:
    1. Aggregation 
        is a weak HAS-A relationship where the child object is careted outside the parent class and can exist independantly.
    2. Composition
        is a strong  HAS-A relationship where the parent class creates and owns the child object , and the child cannot exist independantly.



Is- A relationship:
    Inheritance: child class inherits properties form parent class and we ca achive with the help of extends keyword and implements keywords.

Can we inherit static members?
    yes using super() callling statement .


Super() : It is constructor callling statement it is used to call call constructor of the super class.
          It must be the first statement inside any constructor.
          If programmer has not written this calling statement then by default compiler will add no arguments super calling statement.
          We cannot use  this()  and super() in same constructor
