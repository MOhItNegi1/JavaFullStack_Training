52. Write a Java method clockProblem(int input1, int input2) that simulates a 12-hour analog clock.

	Problem Requirements
	input1 represents the current hour position on a clock (1–12).
	input2 represents the number of jumps/multiplication factor.
	Multiply input1 and input2 to calculate the movement.
	The clock should always stay within 1 to 12.
	If the calculated value exceeds 12, it should wrap around using clock logic.
	If the final calculated position becomes 0, it must be treated as 12.
