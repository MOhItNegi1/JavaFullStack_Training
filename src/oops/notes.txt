Encapsulation:
    the binding or wrapping states and  behaviour of an object is known as Encapsulation.

why do we use Encapsulation?
    : To achive data hiding

What is data hiding?
    : The process oof avoiding direct access but providing controlled access is known as data hiding.

How to avoid direct access?
    : By using Private access modifier / Specifier.
    private keyword
    if we make any member  as private  so we cannot use that variable directly in different class. We can only useq directly in same class.

How to provide controlled access?
    : using getter and setter method .

What is the use of getter method?
    : used to get or retrive private method.
what is the sue of setter method?
    : used to set or modify private method.
